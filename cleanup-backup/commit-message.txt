Fix: Update SSH key deployment configuration and Fastify backend startup for GitHub Actions

This commit addresses SSH key authentication issues and Fastify backend startup failures for GitHub Actions deployment:

- Generate new RSA 4096-bit SSH key pair in PEM format for compatibility
- Update SSH key configuration in GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure proper permissions for SSH authentication
- Fix SSH key format issues with SFTP deploy action
- Configure Fastify backend startup failure with enhanced diagnostics
- Added auto-creation of environment variables (.env) for Fastify
- Implemented direct service testing before background execution
- Added comprehensive diagnostics for startup failures 
- Enhanced error detection with dependency and configuration checks
- Improved startup process with sequential testing and process tracking

This change resolves authentication issues when deploying to cPanel via GitHub Actions and ensures proper SFTP synchronization and service restarts.
