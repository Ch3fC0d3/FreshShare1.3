# Fastify Backend Startup Fix

## Overview of Changes

The Fastify backend startup failure during automated deployment on cPanel has been addressed with a comprehensive set of improvements that focus on process management, error handling, and workflow reliability.

## Key Solutions Implemented

### 1. Robust Production-Ready Server Implementation

- Created a standalone `server.js` CommonJS file that doesn't require TypeScript compilation
- Added proper environment variable loading with fallbacks
- Implemented basic required endpoints: `/health`, `/parse-label`, and `/case-pack`
- Added status file creation (`.server_running`) to confirm successful startup

### 2. Improved Process Management

- Developed a dedicated production startup script `start-backend-prod.sh` that:
  - Uses proper process detachment techniques
  - Kills existing processes before starting new ones
  - Writes PID to a file for better tracking
  - Verifies server startup with multiple checks
  - Implements proper environment loading

### 3. Enhanced GitHub Workflow

- Separated file creation from execution for better error isolation
- Added timeout protection to prevent workflow hanging
- Implemented database connection testing as a separate step
- Added fallback mechanism when timeouts occur
- Created cron jobs to ensure services restart automatically if they fail
- Improved dependency management with targeted package installation

### 4. Increased Error Diagnostics

- Added comprehensive logging during startup
- Implemented multi-stage verification of process state
- Added more detailed error output when failures occur
- Created timeout-protected startup to avoid indefinite hanging

## Usage Instructions

1. Deploy using the new workflow file: `deploy-with-secrets-fixed.yml`
2. If manual deployment is needed, use the `start-backend-prod.sh` script
3. Check for startup issues in `fastify.log`
4. Verify successful startup by looking for the `.server_running` file

## Next Steps for Complete Resolution

1. After deployment, monitor the cron jobs to ensure they are working correctly
2. Consider implementing a more robust process manager like PM2 in the future
3. If persistent issues occur, check database connectivity or firewall settings
4. Update any reverse proxy configurations to correctly point to port 8080
