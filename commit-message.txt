Fix baseUrl paths and links across all templates

- Fixed all login redirects in group-details.ejs to use baseUrl
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/baseurl-configuration-guide.md
- Enhanced test-server.js to support testing with different baseUrl configs
- Added command-line argument support to test-server.js
- Successfully tested with both root and subdirectory paths

These changes ensure the site functions correctly regardless of
deployment path and fixes broken links/images when deployed to subdirectories.
