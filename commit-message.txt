Fix: Update SSH key deployment configuration for GitHub Actions

This commit addresses SSH key authentication issues for GitHub Actions deployment:

- Generate new RSA 4096-bit SSH key pair in PEM format for compatibility
- Update SSH key configuration in GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure proper permissions for SSH authentication
- Fix SSH key format issues with SFTP deploy action
- Update deployment documentation for SSH key setup

This change resolves authentication issues when deploying to cPanel via GitHub Actions and ensures proper SFTP synchronization and service restarts.
