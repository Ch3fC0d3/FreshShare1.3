Fix: Implement Node.js-only production solution for 503 errors

This commit implements a complete Node.js-only solution for the 503 Service Unavailable errors in production:

- Remove Apache dependency and .htaccess configuration
- Add Express server with proxy configuration to Fastify backend
- Create startup scripts for both Express and Fastify services
- Add cron job setup for automatic service restart
- Implement comprehensive diagnostic and deployment scripts
- Create detailed documentation for Node.js-only setup
- Update deployment checklist for the new approach

This solution eliminates the need for Apache configuration and provides a more reliable deployment process using pure Node.js services.
